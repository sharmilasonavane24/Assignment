1. We have some legacy data, which we would like to transform. Legacy data is stored in flat files on a file-system. Some of the files include post codes and we need to identify, where that data is and pull out the lines, which include post codes. Please provide code which will do the above.
-- Created console application named as PostalCodeApp.
File Location: Flat files will be always in Data folder which is included in solution 
assumption : Formate of post code is [<<FourDigitNumber>>][<<Space>>][<<Two letters>>]

After running application on the console it will display lines which include postcode.

2. Please design a service, which would send out «smart alerts» (notifications via push/email/text messages) to clients based on events in their investment portfolios.
-- Created console application named as StockMarketAlertApp.
-- Application contain a notification service which will send email alert based on a change in current stock market price.
After running the application it will ask "Enter Current Stock Price:" Please enter a numeric stock price and press enter.
If there is a change in stock price as compared to the previous price, then Application will send an email alert to clients.
Else Application will not send email Alert.


3. Assume, you’re asked to create a simple REST API for a CRM system. Please describe what you would do and draft the API. 
-- Structure of REST API has been implemented in CrmApp. CrmApp is been developed in .net web API 2
CrmApp has three layers i.e. Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.
-Application Layer will interact with user interfaces.
-Domain layer will contain all services which can communicate with infrastructure.
-Infrastructure layer will communicate to the database context. 

In the application, there is no database, so data has been hardcoded for demo.

4.We use git as a repository for our code. Please share how you see an ideal git branching, given we use three stages for continuous integration: dev, stag, prod. How should versions work? How should hot fixes be deployed?

I have created a repository on Github with braches named as master, dev, stage. I will explain functionality during Interview.
